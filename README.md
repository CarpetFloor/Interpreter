# Interpreter
 My attempt at creating a simple JS-based interpreter. Note that this is currently in very early development, and a lot of basic features are still missing.

# Instructions
To run the interpreter, set the variable `programFile` in `Interpreter.js` to the path of your file. Then run `node Interpreter.js`. At some point, I will *probably* add a GUI.\
