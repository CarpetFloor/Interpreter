# Interpreter
 My attempt at creating a simple JS-based interpreter. Note that this is currently in very early development, and a lot of basic features are still missing.

# Instructions
To run the interpreter, set the variable `programFile` in `Interpreter.js` to the path of your file. Then run `node Interpreter.js`. At some point, I will *probably* add a GUI text editor than can run this language.\
\
Check out [Syntax.md](Syntax.md) for the syntax of this language.\
Also check out [CFG.json](CFG.json) to view the context-free grammar for this language (which the implementation is based upon). To actually open the grammar, you can use [this](https://github.com/thereisatablehere/CFG_Planner) tool.
